/*=============================== confluence check ===========================

The predicates in this file implement a confluence checker for CHR programs
according to the definition of confluence in [Fru09]. There are two
restrictions to the CHR programs that can be used with this confluence
checker:

 1.) No propagation rules: The CHR program to use with this file must not
    contain propagation rules. 
    
 2.) Restricted built-ins: Only = is allowed as built-in constraint.

The most important predicate in this file is the predicate check_confluence/1. 
This predicate checks all CHR rules in a Prolog file and decides whether or not
they are confluent.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
    The predicates in this file write temporary files to your hard-drive. Thus, 
    it needs to be executed in a directory with write access. All files are 
    deleted after the execution.



Predicates in this file:
========================

    check_confluence/1          Checks confluence for a program
    
    check_confluence/2          Checks confluence for a program and returns the 
                                number of non-joinable critical pairs
    
    check_confluence/3          Checks confluence for two rules in a program
    
    check_confluence/4          Checks confluence for two rules in a program 
                                and returns the number or non-joinable critical
                                pairs
    
    show_critical_pairs/1       Print non-trivial CPs of all rules in file

    show_critical_pairs/3       Print non-trivial CPs of a given rule pair

    show_all_critical_pairs/1   Print all CPs of all rules in file

    show_all_critical_pairs/3   Print all CPs of a given rule pair


Datastructures used:
====================

    state(G, B, V)
        A term representing a CHR state. 
        G is a list of CHR constraints, represented as Prolog terms. 
        B is a list of built-in constraints, represented as Prolog terms.
        V is the list of global variables, represented as unbound Prolog 
        variables. This list must not contain duplicates.
        
    rule(S, KH, RH, G, B)
        A term representing a CHR rule. S is the rule together with its name as 
        string as it is represented in the source file. KH, RH, G, B are lists 
        representing the kept head constraints, the removed head constraints, 
        the guard and the body of the rule. KH, and G are possibly empty. 

    cp(S1, S2, R1, R2, O, CAS)
        A term representing a critical pair. 
        S1 and S2 are the two states of the critical pair represented as 
        state(...) terms according to the definition above. 
        R1 and R2 are the CHR rules the critical pair is stemming from. They 
        are represented as rule(...) terms according to the definition above. 
        O is a list of tuples, consisting of pairs of constraints. Those pairs 
        describe the overlap of the two rules which leads to the critical pair. 
        The list [(a(X),a(Y)), (b(X),b(Y))] means, that the head constraint 
        a(X) of the first rule is overlapped with the head constraint a(Y) of 
        the second rule and also the head constraint b(X) of the first rules is 
        overlapped with the head constraint b(Y) of the second rule. 
        The list CAS contains the critical ancestor state of this critical pair.
